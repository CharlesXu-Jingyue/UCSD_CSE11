64
$ java CmdTool min -8 -2 3 5
-8

2. One command option between greater, lesser, or equal and a list of at least 3 integers

3. The -l or -list option followed by one of any command option and a list of at least 3 integers
$ java CmdTool -l equal 2 2 4 8 2 3
2 2
$ java CmdTool -list greater 2 2 4 8 2 3
4 8 3

4. The -l or -list option followed by at least 2 command options and a list of at least 3 integers. Your 2 tests for this situation should not have the same amount of command options after -l
$ java CmdTool -list greater 2 sum 2 4 8 2 3 // greater than 2: 4 8 3; sum: 15
15
$ java CmdTool -list lesser 3 equal 2 sum 2 4 8 2 3 // lesser than 3: 2 2; equal to 2: 2 2; sum: 4
